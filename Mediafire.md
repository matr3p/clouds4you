  14. As such, it is recommended to download the insider folder content first by sharing and using the insider folder url as it differs from the main folder url. Thereafter download from the main link by creating the same name as the original folder and manually delete the additional files in the main folder

  15. Alternatively, have to use base url (not the share folder url), it will respect the folder hierachy (true story)
